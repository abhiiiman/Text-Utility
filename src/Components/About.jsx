                            <strong>I can play with text and do operation on them! </strong>As you can see above i can do numerous things like:
                            converting text into uppercase letters as well as lowercase too, i can also read the text written by you there inside the text area prompt and finally like thanos i also love to swipe all the bs things you've written inside the prompt in one go when you click clear.
